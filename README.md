## Introduction
Hello there! I'm a self-taught, 17 year old programmer that has worked on a generally wide range of projects. My greatest 'creations' thus far is [Ayako](https://www.ayako.one), a Discord Bot, and the winning project of KES2021 Gamejam 'Everlight' which can be found here; for demonstrating creative understanding of the requirements and good game design. I've also participated in numerous competitions including BIO and Bebras. Majority of my projects have been personal, but I hope to expand my sights as soon as I can.
