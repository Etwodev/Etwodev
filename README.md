## Introduction
Hello there! I'm a self-taught, 17 year old programmer that has worked on a generally wide range of projects. My greatest 'creations' thus far is [Ayako](https://www.ayako.one), a Discord Bot, and the winning project of the KES2021 Gamejam 'Everlight' which can be found here; for demonstrating creative understanding of the requirements and good game design. It includes some projectile predictions.  I've also participated in numerous competitions including BIO and Bebras. Majority of my projects have been personal, but I hope to expand my sights as soon as I can.


### Why?
I first got into programming because it acted as a medium where I could make things that could not be easily found as an app or done. Renaming files, automating deletion processes- there were all sorts of things. I then started to see the value of programming- and wanted to get better by learning another language, which would then go on to be C#.
