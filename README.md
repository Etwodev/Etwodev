<br><sub>Hey, I'm Ethan Woods</sub></br>
## Introduction
Hello there! I'm a self-taught, 17 year old programmer that has worked on a generally wide range of projects. The majority of my projects have been personal, but I hope to expand my sights as soon as I can. My greatest 'creations' thus far is [Ayako](https://www.ayako.one), a Discord Bot, and the winning project of the KES2021 Gamejam 'Everlight' which can be found [here](https://etwodev.github.io/projects/2021-27-06/); for demonstrating creative understanding of the requirements and good game design. It also has some projectile predictions.

### Why?
I first got into programming because it acted as a medium where I could make things that could not be easily found as an app or done. Renaming files, automating deletion processes- there were all sorts of things. I then started to see the value of programming- and wanted to get better by learning another language, which would then go on to be C#. I then started participating in competitions, and loved the time-based aspect of problem solving. These include competitions for BIO and Bebras.
